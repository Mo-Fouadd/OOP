//10.(The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class named
//Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make Faculty and
//Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name, address, phone number, and
//email address. A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or
//senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and
//date hired. A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a
//title. Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the
//personâ€™s name. Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them.
//Write a test program that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff,
//and invokes their toString() methods.
